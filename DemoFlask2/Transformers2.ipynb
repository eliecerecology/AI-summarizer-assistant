       "'Nineteen services mentioned by MSM were visited in Yaounde including ten public facilities, four private clinics and five CBO/NGOs. 13/19 services reported specialized training for staff in dealing with MSM or FSW. Seventeen had undertaken HIV counseling and testing in the past month and four had undertaken specialized sessions (for MSM or FSW), twelve had provided ARV medication in last month and only one did not report ARV shortages in the last 12 months. It is noteworthy that of the four services mentioned by at least 10% of the population, three are associations with limited HCT facilities and no clinical provision. Only one of the top four (Hopital Central) reported having ARV capacity in the past four weeks, while also experiencing at least one ARV stock outage in the last 12 months. Additionally, the most frequently cited center by MSM was Humanity First with 40.1% of respondents identifying it while the next highest center was only identified by 19.7% of the population. In 2011 41.8% of MSM reported having accessed the CAMNAFAW clinic or being reached by Humanity First peer educators or outreach workers in the previous 12 months (CARE 2012). In both Care (2012) and the current study, Humanity First has only been able to reach approximately 40% of the MSM population in HIV Prevention for Populations at Risk in Cameroon - final report (4 July 2013).45 the city. Although Humanity First has not reached the majority of MSM respondents it is the most commonly cited service center. This represents a lack of clinical services in Yaounde since Humanity First does not provide HIV testing or ARV medication. MSM in Yaounde are largely not connected to centers that provide HIV testing, treatment, or care. The low levels of access to HIV services are further evidenced in both MSM and FSW populations by the percent of respondents in the city who failed to identify any health centers that provide HIV services. Of all the cities, Yaounde had the second highest number of each population that reported not seeking or receiving HIV prevention, care, and treatment, with 20.4% MSM and 17.2% of FSW reporting seeking or receiving no health services. Eighteen services mentioned by FSW were visited in Yaounde including twelve public facilities, three private clinics and three CBO/NGOs. Eleven services reported specialized training for staff in dealing with MSM or FSW. Seventeen had undertaken HIV counseling and testing in the past month and three had undertaken specialized sessions (for MSM or FSW), twelve had provided ARV medication in last month and only two did not report ARV shortages in the last 12 months. Of the two top services cited by the FSW population, only one had HIV clinical capacity, as the other was Horizon Femme, the PEPFAR HAPP funded association that provides HCT and referral to clinical services in Yaounde and Douala. It is noteworthy that 17.2% of the FSW population in Yaounde reported not seeking or receiving any HIV prevention, care or treatment service. Overall, this implies the coverage of clinical services for the FSW population in Yaound√© is limited. HIV Prevention for Populations at Risk in Cameroon - final report (4 July 2014).46 '"

      "The results of this study indicate that the behavioral and structural risks associated with higher exposure to HIV and other STIs that exist among key populations in other contexts also exist for MSM and FSW in Cameroon. Among the MSM population, while 90.8% (1454/1601) of the population sampled were not officially married, 57.1% (878/1536) reported at least one or more regular female partner. 33.1% (363/1097) of MSM participants used male condoms during every sexual act with a women in the last month, and very few reported the use of female condoms during every sexual act in the last month (1.36%; 15/1106). Among male sexual partners, 53.3% (757/1420) of the population reported they used male condoms during every anal sex act in the past month. These results are similar to earlier results (Care 2012) among MSM in Douala and Yaounde and indicates further behavioral prevention messaging is necessary to address concurrent sexual partners and condom use during all sex acts among this population. Qualitative research elucidated the lack of tailored messaging in prevention programs for same-sex practices, and clarification of the risks associated with same sex practices and concurrency was suggested. Condom-compatible lubricant has also been shown as an effective method to reduce HIV transmission among MSM and some research indicates it is also effective among FSW (Beyrer et al 2012; Baral et al 2012). In this study access to condom-compatible lubricant was reported as exceptionally low among MSM, with 48.7% (640/1313) reporting it difficult to find lubricant. While 79.2% (1324/1596) of the MSM population noted use of commercial sexual lubricant, qualitative data indicates a significant portion of MSM receive lubricant through donor subsidized programs, such as the PEPFAR HAPP program. Condom-compatible lubricant is not available at most of the commonly cited health services by both populations, with less than half providing this commodity within their package of prevention services (40.0%, 10/25). Further subsidy or integration of lubricant into the standard prevention packaging for MSM and FSW is imperative in order to reduce the individual risks of HIV transmission and acquisition in Cameroon. Among FSW, the mean number of clients within the last month was 109.5 across all cities, and the mean number of non-paying sexual partners was, 1.2. A high percentage of FSW in the sample reported it was easy to suggest condom usage with a client (84.4%, 1521/1802), but 40.4% (595/1474) reported it was difficult to suggest condom use to non-paying partners. The vast majority of FSW had been offered more money to have sex without a condom, with 47.9% (865/1804) reporting this experience in the last week, and 24.7% (446/1804) reporting this in the month. HIV Prevention for Populations at Risk in Cameroon - final report (4 July 2013).47 Overall, 40.8% (737/1805) and 41.6% (750/1805) of FSW reported using male condoms with clients every time or almost every time they engaged in vaginal sex within the past month respectively. However, only 13.1% (180/1379) and 14.6% (202/1379) of the population reported using condoms with non-paying partners every time or almost every time they engaged in vaginal sex within the past month respectively. These data are not surprising and correspond to similar data from the 2009 and 2004 FSW sero-prevalence reports from Cameroon (Mosoko et al, 2004; Tamoufe and Medang, 2009). It is recommended that prevention messaging specifically adapted for FSW is developed to address condom use with various types of sexual partners. The data from this study indicate further research into reproductive health and family planning services for FSW is warranted as the percentage of FSW who report having one or more child was 81.3% (1301/1600). This level of motherhood and the known burden of disease among these women implies the services for these women should not be restricted to only the prevention of HIV, and should better address the overall reproductive health needs of the population. In other contexts, we see evidence that antenatal care clinics are an important point of entry into health services, and specifically HIV prevention or care services, and further understanding of the access to health services during pregnancy for FSW (and in relations to PMTCT) in Cameroon is essential (Wilcher et al, 2013). Mothers may also be more likely to access health services in relation to their children‚Äôs needs, and developing comprehensive services that include reproductive health, sexual health and maternal and child health may increase the chances of integration into the health system for women who sell sex and are at higher risk of HIV infection. The overall inconsistent use of condoms among both populations with regular partners in correspondence with the prevalence rates already determined in both populations (37%), is an important determinant of the health needs and targeted prevention programming for key populations in Cameroon. Emerging HIV research indicates that investing and targeting high risk populations in the cascade or continuum of care for HIV is the best long-term solution for their own HIV status as well as for population-level HIV prevention and control. In concentrated, mixed or low level generalized epidemics, researchers have asserted that ensuring effective engagement in the HIV continuum is essential for key populations disproportionately affected by HIV (Baral et al, 2012; Beyrer et al 2012; Gardner et al 2011). \n",

      "Nineteen services mentioned by MSM were visited in Yaounde including ten public facilities, four private clinics and five CBO/NGOs. 13/19 services reported specialized training for staff in dealing with MSM or FSW. Seventeen had undertaken HIV counseling and testing in the past month and four had undertaken specialized sessions (for MSM or FSW), twelve had provided ARV medication in last month and only one did not report ARV shortages in the last 12 months. It is noteworthy that of the four services mentioned by at least 10% of the population, three are associations with limited HCT facilities and no clinical provision. Only one of the top four (Hopital Central) reported having ARV capacity in the past four weeks, while also experiencing at least one ARV stock outage in the last 12 months. Additionally, the most frequently cited center by MSM was Humanity First with 40.1% of respondents identifying it while the next highest center was only identified by 19.7% of the population. In 2011 41.8% of MSM reported having accessed the CAMNAFAW clinic or being reached by Humanity First peer educators or outreach workers in the previous 12 months (CARE 2012). In both Care (2012) and the current study, Humanity First has only been able to reach approximately 40% of the MSM population in HIV Prevention for Populations at Risk in Cameroon - final report (4 July 2013).45 the city. Although Humanity First has not reached the majority of MSM respondents it is the most commonly cited service center. This represents a lack of clinical services in Yaounde since Humanity First does not provide HIV testing or ARV medication. MSM in Yaounde are largely not connected to centers that provide HIV testing, treatment, or care. The low levels of access to HIV services are further evidenced in both MSM and FSW populations by the percent of respondents in the city who failed to identify any health centers that provide HIV services. Of all the cities, Yaounde had the second highest number of each population that reported not seeking or receiving HIV prevention, care, and treatment, with 20.4% MSM and 17.2% of FSW reporting seeking or receiving no health services. Eighteen services mentioned by FSW were visited in Yaounde including twelve public facilities, three private clinics and three CBO/NGOs. Eleven services reported specialized training for staff in dealing with MSM or FSW. Seventeen had undertaken HIV counseling and testing in the past month and three had undertaken specialized sessions (for MSM or FSW), twelve had provided ARV medication in last month and only two did not report ARV shortages in the last 12 months. Of the two top services cited by the FSW population, only one had HIV clinical capacity, as the other was Horizon Femme, the PEPFAR HAPP funded association that provides HCT and referral to clinical services in Yaounde and Douala. It is noteworthy that 17.2% of the FSW population in Yaounde reported not seeking or receiving any HIV prevention, care or treatment service. Overall, this implies the coverage of clinical services for the FSW population in Yaound√© is limited. HIV Prevention for Populations at Risk in Cameroon - final report (4 July 2014).46 \n",

      "This study was conducted in the framework of the 2011-2015 Cameroon National Strategic Plan for the Fight Against HIV/AIDS that highlighted a need to elucidate the health requirements status of key populations in Cameroon. Additionally, Cameroon is currently reviewing this plan and modifying to cover 2014-2017. Key population baseline data will be critical for the proper planning of interventions aiming to significantly decrease the burden of the HIV epidemic in these high risk populations, and indirectly reduce the incidence of new HIV infections in the general population. Despite low HIV prevalence among the general population relative to other regions of sub-Saharan Africa, West and Central Africa contribute a significant proportion of new HIV infections to the global burden due to their large populations (combined regional population ~356 million, World Bank, 2012). While national HIV prevalence ranges from <1%-5% in the region, prevalence among key populations (KP) such as female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) is often significantly higher (UNAIDS 2012). This is consistent with other regions of the world such as Southeast Asia and Latin America where prevalence in the general population remains around or below 5%, and disproportionately higher in key populations such as FSW, MSM and people who inject drugs (PWID) (UNAIDS, 2012). While MSM prevalence data have not been published for Cameroon, peer-reviewed literature since 1991 shows there is elevated prevalence among FSW in the country (Table 1) while the HIV prevalence among the adult general population is 4.3% (National Institute of Statistics 2012). This is reinforced by data from national surveillance in 2009 (Tamoufe and Medang 2009) which estimated a prevalence among FSW at 37% and among MSM in Douala and Yaound√© also at 37% (CARE 2012). This indicates the epidemic in Cameroon is similar to other countries in West and Central Africa and that key populations warrant further investigation and specific programming. To date, there is limited information on MSM in Cameroon and prior to 2011 there was no sero-prevalence data on MSM at all. In contrast in the past decade, two nationwide HIV sero-prevalence studies among FSW were conducted in 2004 (26.4% N=1,005) and 2009 (37% N=999) (Mosoko et al, 2004; Tamoufe and Medang, 2009). \n",

      "Under the Cameroon National Strategic Plan for HIV (2011 ‚Äì 2015), the Government of Cameroon facilitates the availability of HIV testing and counseling at both community and health center based services. Community based organizations (CBO) may provide HIV Testing and Counseling and refer patients on to accredited health services that provide further clinical assessments, usually at a hospital or health center. These services are mainly public, with some private and religious health services accredited to provide comprehensive HIV testing and care. Currently, CBO level prevention activity is restricted to HCT with trained counselors, and the distribution and education regarding condoms and condom compatible lubricant through trained CBO staff and peer educators. Nationally, there are currently two Key Population specific programs that function in five main cities in the country (Bamenda, Bertoua, Kribi, Yaounde, Douala). The USAID HIV AIDS Prevention Program (HAPP), supports CBOs to provide HCT and condom/lubricant distribution to female sex workers (five cities) and men who have sex with men (three cities), with referral to further HIV services, and a Global Fund program, through the Government of Cameroon and an NGO, CAMNAFAW, has begun activity in main cities such as Yaound√©, with plans to scale up nationwide by 2016. Thus, HIV testing and counseling services remain concentrated within the public sector facilities, and are mainly focused on general population level activity, with only nascent programs specifically designed to address the needs of marginalized populations, and reduce the barriers to health services for populations at heightened risk of HIV infection. \n",

      "Eight services mentioned by MSM were visited in Bamenda including three public and five private facilities. Information from one of the services was not possible to obtain, as the service itself refused to respond or consent to participate in this study. One of the services was a PEPFAR HAPP funded Drop-In Center which reported specialized training for staff in dealing with MSM or FSW, however this service had limited capacity to care and treat for HIV positive patients and instead mainly referred patients to other services. All of the HIV Prevention for Populations at Risk in Cameroon - final report (4 July 2014).42 services had undertaken HIV counseling and testing in the past month and the Drop-in Center cited above had undertaken specialized sessions (for FSW or MSM). Six of the eight services had provided ARV medication in last month and three of these reported ARV shortages in the last 12 months. Of the top listed services/centers, one declined to participate in the study, and the other three reported providing ARV medication for people living with HIV/AIDS. One facility reported specialized training for FSW only. This hospital had received support and training through PEPFAR HAPP program in order to manage referrals from the CBO specifically working with FSW in the city. Nine services mentioned by FSW were visited in Bamenda including two public facilities, six private and one CBO. Responses are not available for one public service (PMI Nkwen). Two of the services reported specialized training for staff in dealing with MSM or FSW. All of the services except the CBO had undertaken HIV counseling and testing in the past month and one had undertaken specialized sessions (for FSW or MSM), seven of the nine services had provided ARV medication in last month and four of these reported ARV shortages in the last 12 months. The populations in Bamenda had highest numbers of individuals who had sought or received HIV prevention, care and treatment services, with only 2.2% of FSW and 3.9% of MSM reporting not receiving any HIV service. Disclosure when seeking services however was reported as minimal and qualitative data indicates that these populations in Bamenda feel highly stigmatized and more hidden than their counterparts in other cities. Religious practices and a smaller population were cited as some of the reasons for these feelings among the population. \n",

      "Review of the HIV epidemic in West and Central Africa suggests that the epidemic is relatively concentrated and more closely resembles the epidemics in Southeast Asia and Latin America than the rest of SSA. This highlights the importance of providing adapted and inclusive HIV prevention, care and treatment services to key populations, such as FSW and MSM, more highly affected by the epidemic in the region. The epidemiology of HIV in Cameroon shows the country is not different from other central and west African countries and targeted, cost-effective programs that address not only behavioral, but biological and structural risk factors associated with HIV acquisition and transmission in key populations should be implemented to reduce the onward spread of HIV. Prevention programs should model strategies on the continuum of care and appropriate programs that increase uptake of treatment among key populations, address the barriers to health care that exist in highly stigmatized settings, and ultimately reduce community viral loads and transmission. Structural barriers to health services for key populations include stigma and discrimination, the inability to disclose sexual practices and health needs to health practitioners, and economic limitations to seeking services. Some of these barriers seem to be overcome when specific CBO associations or services are developed to create safe spaces for the population to discuss health issues. While specialized CBOs exist in Cameroon, the clinical capacity of these groups is limited and could be scaled up to provide further HIV care and treatment services to the population. Concurrently, the population also attends general population health services, and in this context disclosure of their sexual orientation or behavior is limited. Developing tailored services for key populations, integrated into general population services may avoid community level stigma and discrimination from deterring individuals from accessing services. The regional disparities of the results also indicate local models should be developed on a city-by-city or region-by-region basis in Cameroon, and community structures should facilitate the relationship between the community and integrated health services. \n",

Frequently we see that the service the most reported in each city is not a service that has invested in staff training or specialized services for these populations. These services are well placed to provide services that can assist in decreasing HIV transmission in this high prevalence group. 32.7% of FSW participants had disclosed their occupation to a doctor or nurse, this varied from 17.3% in Ngaoundere to 49.4% in Bertoua. 9.6% (174/1815) of FSW participants were not able to list a single HIV prevention, testing or treatment service. 68.0% of FSWs indicated they had received HIV prevention information in the last 12 months, of these 66.3% had received information from trained peer educators, 49.5% from media, and 48.0 % from doctors/health providers. This shows that peer educators were an important source of information and they likely probably provide targeted messages appropriate to the FSW community. Additionally, 27.2% of FSW learned to use male condoms from sexual partners, 20.5% from friends, and 19.4% from outreach workers. This demonstrates the importance of outreach/peer education networks for FSW, both in terms of ensuring the quality of information provided and providing specialized, targeted information.

That one service (Baptist Health Center) had no staff trained specifically on the health needs of FSW and MSM, though it did provide ARV medication, and also reported having had a stock shortage in the past 12 months. Douala has the highest disclosure of sexual orientation by MSM to a health provider of all the cities. Douala also has the longest-standing MSM-specific clinic in Cameroon. Alternatives Cameroon is the oldest association in the country that is specifically for the MSM population. Alternatives was the most commonly cited center by MSM in Douala. Additionally, Alternatives has been shown to be effective at reaching high levels of the MSM population in previous studies. In 2011 74.3% of MSM respondents reported having accessed the Access Center clinic at Alternatives or being reached by a peer educator or outreach worker (CARE 2012). The existence of an MSM stand-alone clinic has helped connect a high proportion of MSM to HIV services in Douala and contributes to greater disclosure of sexual orientation to a health care provider in the city. In Douala, 4.8% of MSM and 6.3% of FSW reported seeking, knowing, or receiving no HIV prevention, care or treatment service. \n",

      "The diversity of results among FSW across sites was also noteworthy, though common risk factors indicate prevention programs must focus on condoms with non-paying partners, and reducing the risks of sexual violence including access to PEP. HIV services in collaboration with or integrated into family planning or reproductive health services may greatly increase the uptake of HIV care and treatment among FSW. Addressing user fees and economics barriers to health care for this population may also significantly assist adherence to ART. Implementing regional specific models of care will also benefit the diverse FSW populations across the country. Community-level interventions, where peer educators and counselors are trained in the specific needs of FSW have shown relative success in increasing FSW use of condoms with clients, and linking these community based services to specialized care and treatment facilities will greatly assist the uptake among FSW in HIV specific health services.

      "Numerous studies and data sources covering key populations were obtained from government partners, NGOs and associations. One study provided estimates of SW populations in cities in Cameroon based on mapping and key informants. For MSM two studies presented HIV serology among MSM in Cameroon (Tamoufe and Medang 2009, CARE 2012). A number of other studies (for which data sets were not obtained) collected statistics on clinic or outreach-based HIV testing by NGO and associations. Among female sex workers a series of studies and data were available (see Table 2) showing a growing understanding of prevalence from localized studies to two national seroprevalence studies (Mosoko et al, 2004; Tamoufe and Medang, 2009). Behavioral data also exists, in combination with serological data (SW: Tamoufe and Medang, 2009, CARE 2012) and stand alone behavioral data (eg for FSW a study by WOPA and JHU in Kribi and ACMS and CAMNAFAW studies and among MSM studies and data sets collected by ACMS and CAMNAFAW). A specific study on stigmatization of vulnerable groups (including MSM and FSW) was also undertaken in Yaounde and Douala (FISS-MST/SIDA 2009).

Outside of Yaounde and Douala we see that the services which are most reported are not services that have invested in staff training or specialized services for these populations. These services are well placed to provide services that can assist in decreasing HIV transmission in this high prevalence group. 25.8% of MSM participants had revealed their sexual orientation to a doctor or nurse, this varied from 11.3% in Bertoua to 37.1% in Douala. The sites with no specialized clinical services for MSM were the sites with the lowest levels of disclosure to medical personnel (Bafoussam 23.1%, Bamenda 25.7%, Bertoua 11.3% and Ngaoundere 23.0%). 7.5% (121/1606) of MSM participants were not able to list a single HIV prevention, testing or treatment service. 88.3% of MSM participants indicated they had received HIV prevention information in the last 12 months, of these 78.9% had received information from media, 69.5% from trained peer educators, 68.4 from other MSM, 62.6% from family or friends and 56.9% from doctors/health providers. This shows that while the information obtained from the media by a large proportion of the population would be targeted at the general population, peer educators were an important source of information which was probably providing more targeted messages appropriate to this community. Similarly, 18.5% of MSM learned to use male condoms from outreach workers, 17.1% from sexual partners, 13.8% from AIDS education programs, 13.6% from friends, and only 2.4% learned from medical personnel. Again this reinforces the importance of outreach peer education networks, both in terms of ensuring the quality of information provided and providing specialized, targeted information. MSM listed 25 services in the Bafoussam area, with three mentioned by more than 10% of participants (see Table xiii).

The burden of HIV was established in all data available for triangulation, including peer reviewed literature dating back to the 1990s for FSW. This implies the heightened burden of disease among FSW is not novel, and comprehensive prevention and treatment services designed to address the intricate risks associated with the sale of sex, the social and community stigma and violence surrounding these practices, and the reproductive health needs of these women is imperative for appropriate prevention packages. The significantly heightened burden among MSM, also indicates prevention programs to date have neglected to address the needs of these populations, and best practices and models of service delivery for these men must be developed. \n",

      "This study does not permit national extrapolations outside of major cities, no rural sites were included in the study limiting our ability to understand key populations and access to services in those areas. However, as many of the individuals in those areas will likely be moving to larger cities to seek testing and treatment care the coverage in this report is probably representative of the services they are accessing. Additionally, as the majority of the target populations probably occur in urban centers a large proportion of the population was captured and assessed in this study. Multiple techniques were used for population estimation as each method has limitations and assumptions. For example, estimations by the unique object method are reduced by the closed nature of the communities and the limited methods of access. The objects distributed by CBOs were recuperated in part by working with the same CBOs in areas where they operate. This certainly reduces the population size estimates using this technique. Additionally, estimations by the network sum method without corrections lead to overestimations as the target population will likely know more members of the target population than the general population.

Conclusions ', 'text': 'The costing of HIV interventions in this study is based on 2016 HIV guidelines and considers two scenarios: NASCOP and Standard. The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17, 'country': 'kenya'}\n",
      "{'_id': ObjectId('6093c92a2799b9616a6f8a12'), 'heading': 'Executive Summary ', 'text': 'In 2016, the Ministry of Health (MOH) updated Kenya‚Äôs national HIV guidelines to provide guidance on the use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) to treat and prevent HIV infection. To inform implementation and resource mobilisation, the MOH needed to understand the costing implications of implementing the new guidelines. This created the need for a study to estimate the costs of implementing the new guidelines, based on the country targets and covering all known people living with HIV in Kenya. This study adopted a micro-costing approach using population data from 2015 HIV revised estimates. The study considered two costing scenarios‚Äîthe ‚ÄúNASCOP scenario,‚Äù based on NASCOP (National AIDS/STI Control Programme) targets to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets; and the ‚ÄúStandard scenario,‚Äù based on full adoption of the new guidelines. The results show that the average annual unit cost of an adult on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The unit cost varies by regimen type, with the unit cost of an adults first-line regimen being Ksh 9,501.44 (US$91.4) per year, compared to Ksh 26,499.20 (US$254.8) for second-line. The annual unit cost of pediatric ARVs was estimated at Ksh 17,800.64 (US$171.2) per patient. As shown in Table E1, implementation of the new antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines under the Standard scenario will cost about 20 percent more than under the NASCOP scenario. The estimated cost of implementingthe new guidelines under the NASCOP and Standard scenarios in the next four years (FY2016/17‚Äì2019/20) is Ksh 197.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) and Ksh 239.2 billion (US$2.3 billion), respectively. The higher costs under the Standard scenario can explained by the higher number of people living with HIV expected to be initiated on treatment. In both scenarios, key commodities (ARVs, laboratory management, and test kits) are the main cost drivers, accounting for 61 percent of the total cost (seeTable E1).

Conclusions ', 'text': 'The costing of HIV interventions in this study is based on 2016 HIV guidelines and considers two scenarios: NASCOP and Standard. The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17}\n",

In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17, 'country': 'kenya'}\n"

To inform implementation and resource mobilisation, the MOH needed to understand the costing implications of implementing the new guidelines. This created the need for a study to estimate the costs of implementing the new guidelines, based on the country targets and covering all known people living with HIV in Kenya. This study adopted a micro-costing approach using population data from 2015 HIV revised estimates. The study considered two costing scenarios‚Äîthe ‚ÄúNASCOP scenario,‚Äù based on NASCOP (National AIDS/STI Control Programme) targets to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets; and the ‚ÄúStandard scenario,‚Äù based on full adoption of the new guidelines. The results show that the average annual unit cost of an adult on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The unit cost varies by regimen type, with the unit cost of an adults first-line regimen being Ksh 9,501.44 (US$91.4) per year, compared to Ksh 26,499.20 (US$254.8) for second-line. The annual unit cost of pediatric ARVs was estimated at Ksh 17,800.64 (US$171.2) per patient.

The estimated cost of implementingthe new guidelines under the NASCOP and Standard scenarios in the next four years (FY2016/17‚Äì2019/20) is Ksh 197.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) and Ksh 239.2 billion (US$2.3 billion), respectively. The higher costs under the Standard scenario can explained by the higher number of people living with HIV expected to be initiated on treatment.
