       "'The costing of HIV interventions in this study is based on 2016 HIV guidelines and considers two scenarios: NASCOP and Standard. The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20'"

Conclusions ', 'text': 'The costing of HIV interventions in this study is based on 2016 HIV guidelines and considers two scenarios: NASCOP and Standard. The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17, 'country': 'kenya'}\n",
      "{'_id': ObjectId('6093c92a2799b9616a6f8a12'), 'heading': 'Executive Summary ', 'text': 'In 2016, the Ministry of Health (MOH) updated Kenya’s national HIV guidelines to provide guidance on the use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) to treat and prevent HIV infection. To inform implementation and resource mobilisation, the MOH needed to understand the costing implications of implementing the new guidelines. This created the need for a study to estimate the costs of implementing the new guidelines, based on the country targets and covering all known people living with HIV in Kenya. This study adopted a micro-costing approach using population data from 2015 HIV revised estimates. The study considered two costing scenarios—the “NASCOP scenario,” based on NASCOP (National AIDS/STI Control Programme) targets to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets; and the “Standard scenario,” based on full adoption of the new guidelines. The results show that the average annual unit cost of an adult on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The unit cost varies by regimen type, with the unit cost of an adults first-line regimen being Ksh 9,501.44 (US$91.4) per year, compared to Ksh 26,499.20 (US$254.8) for second-line. The annual unit cost of pediatric ARVs was estimated at Ksh 17,800.64 (US$171.2) per patient. As shown in Table E1, implementation of the new antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines under the Standard scenario will cost about 20 percent more than under the NASCOP scenario. The estimated cost of implementingthe new guidelines under the NASCOP and Standard scenarios in the next four years (FY2016/17–2019/20) is Ksh 197.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) and Ksh 239.2 billion (US$2.3 billion), respectively. The higher costs under the Standard scenario can explained by the higher number of people living with HIV expected to be initiated on treatment. In both scenarios, key commodities (ARVs, laboratory management, and test kits) are the main cost drivers, accounting for 61 percent of the total cost (seeTable E1).

The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17}\n",

The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17, 'country': 'kenya'}\n"

To inform implementation and resource mobilisation, the MOH needed to understand the costing implications of implementing the new guidelines. This created the need for a study to estimate the costs of implementing the new guidelines, based on the country targets and covering all known people living with HIV in Kenya. This study adopted a micro-costing approach using population data from 2015 HIV revised estimates. The study considered two costing scenarios—the “NASCOP scenario,” based on NASCOP (National AIDS/STI Control Programme) targets to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets; and the “Standard scenario,” based on full adoption of the new guidelines. The results show that the average annual unit cost of an adult on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The unit cost varies by regimen type, with the unit cost of an adults first-line regimen being Ksh 9,501.44 (US$91.4) per year, compared to Ksh 26,499.20 (US$254.8) for second-line. The annual unit cost of pediatric ARVs was estimated at Ksh 17,800.64 (US$171.2) per patient. As shown in Table E1, implementation of the new antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines under the Standard scenario will cost about 20 percent more than under the NASCOP scenario. The estimated cost of implementingthe new guidelines under the NASCOP and Standard scenarios in the next four years (FY2016/17–2019/20) is Ksh 197.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) and Ksh 239.2 billion (US$2.3 billion), respectively. The higher costs under the Standard scenario can explained by the higher number of people living with HIV expected to be initiated on treatment.
